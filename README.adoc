# Comparing Distributed Programming in Rust and Go

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to compare the programming languages Rust and Go regarding their capabilities and characteristics for distributed programming.

## Serialization and Messaging

One thing that is pretty much inevitable when it comes to distributed systems programming is to have some form of messaging solution so that individual computing nodes can exchange serialized data.

A widely used solution for this is Google's gRPC so let's take a look at gRPC implementations for Go and Rust.

On https://www.crates.io[crates.io] you can find multiple crates (Rust's version of packages/libraries) that offer gRPC implementations. The most promising one at the time seems to be https://crates.io/crates/tonic[tonic] because it has the highest number of all-time and recent downloads.

## Asynchronous Programming

## Available Frameworks  

## Additional Thoughts

One central aspect of Rust's philosophy is its focus on performance.
Although better low-level performance is in general a good thing, this particular advantage of Rust might not be as useful when it comes to building distributed systems. Since the performance of a distributed system as a whole tends to be constrained more by network latency than by the execution time of individual tasks.

On the other hand, the fact that Rust offers very good memory efficiency means that it could be suited very well for distributed systems that keep a lot of data in memory at a time. For example, the authors of the Ballista framework claim that:

__"The combination of Rust and Arrow provides excellent memory efficiency and memory usage can be 5x - 10x lower than Apache Spark in some cases"__footnote:[https://github.com/ballista-compute/ballista#how-does-this-compare-to-apache-spark]
